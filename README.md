This project is a Student Course Enrollment System developed using the MVC (Model–View–Controller) architecture. The Model is handled through Mongoose, which manages student and course data stored in MongoDB.

The View layer is built using EJS templates with layout support to render dynamic web pages.

The Controller layer, implemented using Express.js, handles routing, user requests, and application logic.

The system allows users to view, add, and manage student and course details efficiently. By following the MVC structure, the project ensures clear separation of concerns, making the application more organized, scalable, 
and easier to maintain.
